Our Room Planner system makes it easier than ever to manage projects, 
integrating smoothly with our CRM to give teams a real-time, 
bird’s-eye view of everything happening with each project. 
From the moment a project is created, through client orders and all the way to production, 
the system keeps everyone on the same page. Teams can quickly filter, search, and update project details, 
which boosts communication and transparency across departments.

Clients are able to interact with their projects in 3D, customizing doors, 
walls, and furniture. Any changes they make are instantly reflected in the system, 
giving them the most up-to-date information. Once an order is placed, 
sales and logistics teams see it immediately, removing any delays and confusion.

By eliminating double data entry and integrating directly with Odoo, 
the system gives clients the ability to track their orders, while teams gain better control over the entire process. 
The entire flow from project concept to production is streamlined, improving operational efficiency and reducing errors along the way.

Everything happens within one centralized platform, so all stakeholders are aligned, 
informed, and able to make better decisions faster. 
It’s a seamless experience that simplifies the complexities of managing projects, 
ensuring everyone’s on the same page and that nothing falls through the cracks
