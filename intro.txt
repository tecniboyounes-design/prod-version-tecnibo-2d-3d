Our Room Planner system integrates with our CRM, offering teams a real-time, bird’s-eye view of projects from creation to production. 
It streamlines communication by allowing teams to quickly filter, search, and update project details.


Clients can interact with their projects in 3D, customizing doors, walls, and furniture. 
Changes are instantly reflected, ensuring up-to-date information. Once an order is placed, 
sales and logistics teams are notified immediately, removing delays.


By eliminating double data entry and integrating with Odoo, the system enhances order tracking and gives teams better control. 
The process from concept to production is streamlined, boosting efficiency and reducing errors.


Everything is managed on one platform, ensuring all stakeholders stay aligned and informed, enabling faster, more informed decision-making.
