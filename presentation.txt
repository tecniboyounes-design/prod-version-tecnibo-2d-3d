We’re integrating the Room Planner with our local server on Ubuntu 24 LTS, linked to Odoo for project and purchase order management. 
This server is accessible to all our clients, including via the iOS Room Planner app and other connected platforms. 
It streamlines everything from project creation to order tracking.

For authentication, we’re using session IDs and permissions to ensure secure access.

We’re also working on syncing the Room Planner with IMOS R3F, 
where we’ll store articles in the database for easier material and product management.

We’re adding real-world pricing by integrating the price list for products and materials, 
so the Room Planner can give accurate pricing for items used in interior design projects.

I’ll be working with Hamza and Rabie3 to integrate articles into the Room Planner so users can easily place them into designs.

We’ll also create an endpoint to receive room dimensions from the iPhone Room Planner app. 
This will create a project in our local Room Planner DB, which will then be connected to Odoo in production mode, 
making the process smoother from concept to execution.

Additionally, we’re running the local server so our DM team can work with the Room Planner locally for testing and collecting feedback.
